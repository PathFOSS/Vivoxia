# Advanced Fitness Tracker for Android

Vivoxia is an all-in-one application for a fitness enthusiast, featuring journals, goal settings, workout timer, and more.

This app is minimal with under 10 MB of storage required to begin. There is zero tracking or analytics and everything you do is saved offline.

The app supports all units and can be configured with both imperial and metric units.

The application is completely Free and Open Source (FOSS) and falls under the GPLv3 license.

## Important notice

Vivoxia is optimized for phones. Tablets and wearables might work but probably won't.

The app might crash for no reason since it is still in early development. Please create an issue whenever possible.

Deleting the app, clearing cache, or losing your phone means that all your data is lost.

2. Exercise list imports from online sources (saved locally)
3. More advanced graphing options (e.g. measuring volume per muscle or overlaying two measures)
4. Include alcohol and fiber in macronutrients options
